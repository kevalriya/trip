<h4><strong><span class="c3">Our Website:</span></strong></h4>
<p class="c22"><span class="c2">TripON is an online Marketplace, which gives prospective travelers and bus operators in Nigeria a platform to connect. In light of the foregoing, TripON wishes to state the following: </span></p>

<ol class="c4 lst-kix_list_12-1 start" start="1">
  <li class="c0"><span class="c2">The Website is a marketplace, which merely lists the inventory of bus operators who are registered with the Website, but does not own the services per se. Hence, the limited role of the Website is to connect You with the bus operator and vice versa.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_list_12-1" start="2">
  <li class="c0"><span class="c2">You understand and agree that the fare of the bus tickets listed and/or offered for sale by the bus operator on the Website is solely determined by the respective Bus Operators, and TripON.ng has no control over the fare of the tickets listed on the Website. In the event, the minimum and/or the maximum fare of the tickets, is in contravention of any law and/or any order or judgment of any regulatory authority/Tribunal/Court, it shall be the sole responsibility of the respective bus operator to ensure that such fare is in compliance with the law/order/judgment, and TripON.ng shall in no way be liable for such contravention of the law/order/judgment. </span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_list_12-1" start="3">
  <li class="c0"><span class="c2">In light of the foregoing, You agree that any liability in relation to any services being offered on the Website in accordance with the applicable laws shall be that of the bus operator and not TripON.ng. In case of any deficiency of service, You agree to pursue any such action arising from such deficiency of service against the Bus Operator and not the TripON.ng.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_list_12-1" start="4">
  <li class="c0"><span class="c2">You further agree and acknowledge that the TripON.ng is only a facilitator and is not and cannot be a party to or control in any manner any transactions on the Website. Accordingly, the contract of sale of services on the Website shall be a strictly bipartite contract between You and the Bus Operators listed on the Website. </span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_list_12-1" start="5">
  <li class="c0"><span class="c2">You further agree and acknowledge that all the 'discounts/coupons (if any)' on the Website/prices at which the tickets are being sold by the bus operator on the Website is merely an “invitation to offer” in accordance with the applicable law and shall not be construed to be an “offer” in accordance with the applicable law. Hence, in light of the foregoing, when you agree to purchase the bus tickets listed on the Website by the Bus Operator, that would be termed as a 'valid offer' under the applicable law. Subsequently, when the same is being confirmed by the bus operator it is tantamount to be a 'valid contract' as per the applicable law. </span></li>
