<p>From little towns and villages like Biu in Borno, Bokkos in Plateau, Igueben in Edo, Demsa in Adamawa, Gumel in Jigawa, Ikire in Osun to the large cities or metropolitans like Lagos, Kano, Abuja, Port Harcourt; road transportation remains the mode of transportation of choice for majority of the Nigerian public. Most goods are moved from place to place, around the country – from farms in the rural areas to consumers in cities and the urban centres; from factories to markets; from the petroleum refineries in the Niger Delta to the numerous petrol stations scattered across the country – predominantly by road.</p>

<p>Although there is no empirical study to support this, it is safe to state that majority of the 170 million Nigeria rely on buses for mass transit. The bus transportation system in Nigeria is a huge industry that cannot be ignored. Therefore as the population's behavioural habits change with the recent introduction and adoption of smartphones applications, market players must change along to remain relevant in the industry.</p>

<p>Gone have become the days when passengers would wake up before dawn to line up at the bus terminal in order to get a seat on the early-morning bus from Benin City to Lagos. In those days, once the first bus is filled and departs, all remaining passengers would wait for an afternoon bus or try out another bus operator. It was a loss-loss for both parties – the bus operator lacked adequate insight into the passenger behaviour, and could not convert these passengers into actual travellers. An opportunity lost! The passengers on the other hand suffered delays, frustration and disappointment. On the flip side and in today’s technology-driven world, an online bus reservation system will ensure that passengers can book their bus tickets, select the seats of their choice online, at any time and from anywhere, and head to the bus terminal with peace of mind, knowing that their seats are guaranteed. Also taking advantage of technology, the bus operator can immediately schedule another bus for this route upon finding that there is unusual influx of passengers. In some cases, it may be economically smart to re-route buses from dry routes to routes with unusual high influx of passengers.</p>

<p>The TripON online bus reservation system is an automated system for purchasing bus tickets. Passengers with access to the Internet can using this platform purchase their bus tickets online from anywhere in the world and at any time of the day or night without having to visit the bus terminal. Besides displaying an interactive seat map of the bus and giving passengers the opportunity to choose specific seats, this system also gives passengers the opportunity to choose certain buses that meet their preference. For example, a passenger may want a bus service whose offering includes A/C, TV/DVD, WIFI, Power Outlets, Cargo Space, Toilet, Newspapers, Meals etc. As in most other countries of the world, many Nigerians have become inseparable from their smartphones and other mobile devices. Besides the traditional communication for which the phones were originally designed, they are now being used for gaming, navigation, music, bank and other online transactions. Here lies the opportunity for bus operators.</p>

Besides airlines in Nigeria, all other public transportation systems use the traditional paper-based ticketing and payment system, which is replete with problems. Some common problems associated with this system include:</p>

<p>(a). Each operator branch office is blind to the activities or sales at other branch offices. To determine the latest update on seat availability or schedule or other reservation-related information, a phone call has to be made to enquire.</p>
<p>(b). Double-bookings or over-capacity bookings are common even within same office.</p>
<p>(c). Unlike in the airline industry all over the world where seat reservations can be made around the clock, seat reservation on buses is limited to official working hours of the day – usually 8am to 4pm.</p>
<p>(d). Customers are commonly found in long queues in an effort to buy tickets or make travel enquiries.</p>
<p>(e). Human errors  - miscalculations in ticket price, mistakes in passenger bio-data, etc</p>
<p>(f). Tipping/Gratuity – ticket counters have become known for a place when every customer is expected to give a tip in order to receive the desired service.</p>

<p>Your Business is Open Around the Clock: Using an online reservation system means that your business is open 24 hours a day and seven days a week, as customers can make travel reservations, seat selection and online payments at anytime of the day or night. Considering the level of monitoring of Internet usage that occurs in many workplaces today, most Nigerians would rather consider it more convenient to make their reservations from home at night. Moreover, most Nigerians have smartphones today, and with this they can make reservation anytime and from anywhere.</p>

<p>Real-time Omnichannel Sales Management: Knowing that passenger transport is a low margin business, it is imperative for a bus operator to seek out every potential passenger. It is therefore critically important that you have a true picture of seat availability for your bus advertised in real-time to as wide as possible to your network of potential passengers. The online bus reservation system presents your business to the world, to every potential bus passenger to see. They can see the seat availability, the luxury services (preferences) you offer, your fares, your departure time, your bus seat maps, your route map including the drop-off points and estimated arrival time, how you are rated by previous passengers, the discount offered if any, etc. </p>

<p>Get Paid Quicker: Our Online Reservation System requires customers to prepay for trips, and once they do their chosen seats area marked unavailable to other prospective travellers. This puts money into your pocket faster and helps make sure that on the day of the event you don't have to worry about payment — giving you and your customers more time to have fun.</p>

The spot automatically re-opens online, giving another customer the chance to book it, and thereby maximizing your reservations on every bus.</p>

<p>Presenting a Simple Unified View: Our Online Reservation System at each Bus Operator facility will be linked to a large-size TV screen where customers and staff alike can see seat availability very clearly in real time. Once a seat is booked, it is seen as booked by all customers, all sales staff, all offices/branches. This makes double-booking a seat impossible.</p>

<p>Self-Service Capability: A great way to reduce labour costs is to let more passengers manage their travel-related activities by themselves. While this results in fewer employee needs at your call-centres and support desks, it also results in increased customer satisfaction because passengers can manage their trip details whenever they want without having to deal with other people. It is a win-win situation. In the past, introduction of vending machines was one such way to reduce labour costs while maintaining presence at important locations. The arrival of TripOn.ng – an online bus reservation system – to digital sales channel which you can use from the comfort of your house or anywhere else at any time has no competition.</p>

<p>Modern Digital Marketing Tools: The bus reservation system is a source of valuable data that the bus operator can use for marketing (with consent, of course). Without proper digital marketing tools, a bus company doesn’t exist for millennial. An intercity bus company has to be present in most of the digital channels so that finding them will be as fast and easy as possible for the passenger of the future. The marketing toolbox which should at least include the tools for social media, campaigns, email marketing, loyalty schemes, have been proven in other climes to successfully attract millennial. It is important to note that a fundamental characteristic of a well-made bus reservation system is its ability to improve bus ridership. And TripOn.ng does exactly that! TripOn.ng captures and stores every relevant customer data including names, age, gender, street address, email address, phone number, date of trip, trip starting point and destination, trip preferences (e.g. vehicle type, A/C, WIFI, Meals), expenses, revenue, etc in a database. Customer data remains a most-valued resource in any business today, and this will be invaluable in marketing yourself to customers for repeat patronage. At TripOn.ng, we also provide you with a dashboard of analytics that help you grow your business, quickly determining your most popular sellers, the most requested time slots, the most commonly travelled routes or the most profitable routes. Bus Operator has ability to monitor the actual travellers’ behaviours, allowing the Bus Operator the opportunity to respond to the needs of travellers, thereby boosting business.</p>
